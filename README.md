# Project 2
For this project I chose to do number 5 from project 1 which is "Write a script that tells you how much hard drive space you have left" 
# What it does
Tells you how much hard drive space you have left and tells you how much space has been used.
# How to run 
You need to have Python installed on your system. Save the script to a file with a .py extension (check_disk_space.py) and then run it using a command prompt or terminal

python check_disk_space.py
