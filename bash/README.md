# Final Project
For the final project I am writing a script that creates a game of checkers
# What is does
Creates the game and sets up the pieces
# How to run
You need to have python instsalled on your system. Within the python software make sure you save and then run the code. 
Once you run you will get the option to make a move and to do that you have to enter the coordinates from the set of numbers on the left and top.
